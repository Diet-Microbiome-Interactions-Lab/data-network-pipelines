## README File Corresponding to 'base_metagenomics.sm'

Initial tree structure of working directory should follow this pattern:

.
├── config
│   ├── cluster.json
│   └── config.yaml
├── input
│   ├── assembly
│   │   └── W1.contigs.fasta
│   └── reads
│       ├── 043948_W12-D7_R1_10000.fastq
│       └── 043948_W12-D7_R2_10000.fastq
├── README.md
├── results
└── workflow
    ├── envs
    │   └── alignment.yaml
    ├── logs
    ├── scripts
    └── snake.smk
Note: This general pattern may change depending on the analysis, but should follow a similar pattern.

## File purposes:
cluster.json
- File containing information to submit snakemake job to SLURM
config.yaml
- Theoretically this job should be the only file, not including the files inside of the input folder,
    that gets changed from analysis to analysis. This file contains project information and file path
    locations.
envs/*.yaml
- Files specifying the dependencies to be used by the pipeline
scripts/*
- Custom script files to be ran by the pipeline under specific rules
logs/*.log
- Log files that are automatically created when running the pipeline
snake.smk
- The main snakemake file that contains rules and local variables

### Below is a snippet that lets SLURM know how to submit the jobs to the cluster:
-j 5 --cluster-config config/cluster.json --cluster "sbatch -A {cluster.account} --mem {cluster.mem} \
-t {cluster.time} --cpus-per-task {cluster.cpus}"

The above parameters inside of the cluster.json file may need to be changed depending on the job.





# Example 1: Running Snakemake
Given the tree structure above, first index the assembly file (W1.contigs.fasta):

1. Since all paths are relative to the snake.smk file, first enter the directory containing snake.smk
2. Add the following code to the empty snake.smk file:
# --- Start of File --- #
rule all:
    input:
        expand("AssemblyIndex/{index}.1.bt2", index=config['index'])

rule index_assembly:
    input:
        config["assembly"]
    params:
        index=config["index"],
        threads=config["threads"]
    conda:
        "envs/alignment.yaml"
    output:
        f"AssemblyIndex/{config['index']}.1.bt2"
    logs:
        f"log/assemblyIndexing.{config['index']}.log"
    shell:
        """
        bowtie2-build -f --threads {params.threads} {input} AssemblyIndex/{params.index} >> {log}
        """
# ---- End of File ---- #

The config file should look like this:
# --- Start of File --- #
assembly: "../input/assembly/W1.contigs.fasta"
index: "W1"
threads: 20
# ---- End of File ---- #

3.) Execute a test run of the rule using the following command:
$ snakemake -s snake.smk -np
Note: the option -np results in a dry run, where no computations are performed but rules are checked for errors.

4.) Execute the rule by submitting it to SLURM:
$ nohup snakemake -s snake.smk --use-conda -j 5 --cluster-config ../config/cluster.json --cluster "sbatch -A {cluster.account} \
 --mem {cluster.mem} -t {cluster.time} --cpus-per-task {cluster.cpus}" &

Note1: Yes, include the above " (quotes)
Note2: By adding 'nohup' to the start and '&' to the end, this runs the job in the background and will allow the
job to remain running even when ssh connection has been terminated.

This job will result in the following new files:
- Multiple index files for the .FASTA assembly, located in the workflow/AssemblyIndex/ folder
- A new log file located in the workflow/logs/ folder
