## TODO
- Move generalScripts to GeneralTools where it makes sense. Only have little scripts that are specific to Snakemake in there
- Snakemake file naming convention established and documented
- Make sure each rule follows our preferred names for file types (and documented)
- Test scripts for each workflow or rule
- Figure out a way to separate buckets of work, or how others can easily grab a folder and be able to run a complete workflow.
